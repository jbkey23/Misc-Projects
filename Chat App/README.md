#Chat Application

This is a class group project for my web development class. My main contribution to this application was the communication setup between this front-end and backend.

This is a Node.js project and can be run by completing the following steps:

Once inside of the root folder:

+ npm install
+ run the chat_app.js file (node chat_app.js)
